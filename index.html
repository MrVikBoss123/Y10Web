    <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"> This website was created on the ninth of January, in the year of 2350 A.D. in the Gregorian Calendar. There are now 29 continents and 11 countries on the planet Earth, the most powerful of which is Sri Lanka. The United States abandoned this planet in 2149 A.D.; after declaring a state of national emergency due to the dangerously high temperatures which had risen to an extremely unstable level because of peoplekind's failure to react to global warming. On the fourth of July, in the year of 2148 A.D., every tax-paying, legal citizen of the United States of America was offered a spot on a shuttle headed for the Oort Cloud. Each and every citizen accepted. </p>
    <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"> However, due to the large number of spacecrafts evacuating the troposphere, a few ships accidentally crossed into North Korean airspace. North Korea, having defeated South Korea at the battle of Kim in 2080 A.D., now occupied the land which had belonged to the Soviet Union, and later Russia, prior to 2071 A.D., when the Russian Government attempted to use a newly-invented frost bomb to counteract the effects of global warming. Long story short, the only city in what was the world's largest country which did not suffer average temperature drops by more than 30 degrees celsius was Yakutsk, Siberia. </p>
    <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"> The first American spacecraft was detected by North Korean radar at 6:00 a.m., on the fifth of November. The North Korean leader, Kim Sung XXVIII, reacted instantly, informing the U.S. Government that should they continue to ascend into restricted airspace, that they will be informed of their crimes within a reasonable amount of time. He stressed that, if charged, the United States' rockets will be annotated. The entire North Korean military would then accompany the governing body to Kim Sung XXVIII's office, and he would determine what, if any, penalties the United States would suffer in addition to a 0% on any UN conducted examination from then on (North Korea had become the sole member of the UN after the United States decided to create the USN. However, an error in the fine print of the official document led to the entire organization being disbanded three days after it was created.)  </p>
    <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"> Fortunately for the United States, their advanced spacecrafts, which were built on the prototype innovated by Jinoo Kim (PhD, Astrophysics; The Implementation of the Cronin Constant in Bose-Einstein Antithermal Engines, Class of 2030 A.D.), were able to outdistance even the advanced North Korean radar systems. The spacecrafts ascended rapidly into the atmosphere before turning and plotting a heading towards the sun. Apparently, IMF expert Daniel Botros, who had also discovered the secret of immortality by genetically modifying the process of mitosis in his body using modular arithmetic, had somehow managed to decrease the temperature of the average star by a factor of 10,000,000,000 by manipulating the force created by the fusion of two plutonium atoms into an outrageously strong inter-molecular force (Between particles of antimatter, naturally.) </p>
    <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"> The United States' airships were never seen again. Botros' plan had been to solidify and cool the sun's crust to be able to live on its surface comfortably, while receiving heat from its heated core. Some sources say that Botros incorrectly stated the number of valence electrons in a neutral atom of chlorine to be eight; others argue that he planned to escape from inside the sealed spaceships and somehow propel himself back to Earth in a timespan of forty-eight hours, to finish masterminding the anticipated victory of Egypt in the 2152 Fifa World Cup (Antarctica was the proposed venue.) Either way, neither Botros nor the ships ever found their way back to Earth. Three years after the event, World Science Club Head Alex Bastin took the liberty of examining the sun for signs of life using a telescope capable of detecting a baby's footprints on a gravel path over the distance from the Earth to the Sun. He found none. </p>
    <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"> Immediately following the United States' departure, The Supreme Being (Arun Atchuthananthan) saw his opportunity to propel himself and Sri Lanka into the upper eschalons of human civilization. By calculating the x, y, z, and zz intercepts of the octic equation which models the path of quarks in relation to the positioning of positrons in different antiparticles, The Supreme Being became the first human being to fly, the first human being to break the speed of light, and the first human being to attain the ability to teleport anywhere in the observable universe. Having achieved these phenomenally difficult feats, The Supreme Being set about achieving his next milestone: ensuring Sri Lanka a spot in the quarter finals of the 2152 Fifa World Cup. While The Supreme Being was able to hack into a firewall which he estimated to be 8951 times stronger than the firewall which had protected The Pentagon, he was not able to avoid a hotly anticipated showdown between his team and the extremely talented Egyptian Squad, led by two of the world's greatest players: Mohammed Salah XXI, and Moses (Whom Daniel Botros had managed to resurrect using bits of information found on his blood type, as well as an extremely complicated, modified version of combustion analysis. The countries which remained in the World Cup are shown below. </p>

    <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"> Unfortunately, The Supreme Being could not secure a World Cup victory by himself. In the fall of 2167 A.D., his fingers accidentally slipped while he was punching in the coordinates for his next destination on his teleportation device. This resulted in his being sent to the furthest reaches of the known universe, a distance of sixteen Arun-Years away. While there was nothing which The Supreme Being Himself could do to directly improve the situation, he managed to contact professional coder Odosa Obasuyi. </p>
    <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"> After a particularly devastating earthquake which left Wakanda's vibranium shields crumpled like tinfoil, the lone survivor and inhabitant of the country sought refuge in Canada. Having known The Supreme Being throughout most of his life, he was now the most experienced coder on Earth, being proficient in 257 programming languages. He was extremely well-acquainted with The Supreme Being, and so thought nothing of most of his requests. However, The Supreme Being's unusual request had caught him off guard, and, after some thought, he set to work. </p>
    <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;"> Eyewitnesses who may have peered through the crystal-clear glass windows of the World Wide Web Consortium's head office on a fateful August 23, 2182 A.D., at 11:58 p.m., would have glimpsed a countenance resembling that of sheer terror on Odosa Obasuyi's visage, as he desperately tried to engineer a method to upload his code to Github, much to the dismay of The Supreme Being and whatever was left of The Football Federation of Sri Lanka. </p>
